## Data preprocessing

From the dataset we can learn that:
1. The language of texts is not English (According to google translation, it is Indonesian, but there are some English words mixed in it).
2. Some texts contain `\n`, e.g.:

    1095,"Wohooo just love it
    P.s: That phupii ka walima cracked me up"

3. Some texts contain emojis, e.g.:

    758,hum tu hanstay b ni ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
    891,jab bh bolna kachra hi ugalna :)

4. The use of punctuation in text is not standardized (in order to express the tone), e.g.:

    599,Its just to provoke for jihad ..it was the biggest drama ......but flopped ...

5. There are misspellings in the text (some of them are meant to express a strong tone), e.g.:

    1594,Soooooo heartbreaking. Ya Allah in yahodyun ko gharq krdey,Negative
